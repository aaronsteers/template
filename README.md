# Evidence Template Project

Welcome to Evidence. Use this project template to get started.

[Share your feedback with the Evidence team](https://du3tapwtcbi.typeform.com/to/GZNZe1GY)

## Getting Started

Check out the docs for [alternative install methods](https://docs.evidence.dev/getting-started/install-evidence) including Docker, Github Codespaces, and alongside dbt.

```bash
npx degit evidence-dev/template my-project
cd my-project 
npm install 
npm run sources
npm run dev 
```

Once you've launched Evidence, this project includes a short tutorial to help you get started.

Don't clone this repo, just download the code using the steps above.

## Codespaces

If you are using this template in Codespaces, click the Start Evidence button in the bottom left toolbar, or use the following commands to get started:

```shell
npm install
npm run sources
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

See [the CLI docs](https://docs.evidence.dev/cli/) for more command information.

**Note:** Codespaces is much faster on the Desktop app. After the Codespace has booted, select the hamburger menu â†’ Open in VS Code Desktop.

## Universal SQL

- Evidence projects now include a SQL runtime powered by [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/).
- Queries written in markdown files use this runtime. 
- These queries can run across all of your data sources, meaning you can join data from two separate data sources. 
- These SQL queries can accept inputs, allowing you to build interactive reports, and pass variables into them from templated pages.
- These queries are very performant, and allow you to work with much larger data sets  


### Multiple Datasources

Projects can now connect to multiple data sources simultaneously. For example, a `Snowflake` connection and a `Postgres` connection. 

Data sources are no longer restricted to SQL databases. We're adding support for direct connections to APIs and other tools. 

The `sources` folder in Evidence projects is undergoing major changes; instead of containing standalone `.sql` files and
`.csv` files, it is now made up of directories that each define different data sources (e.g. a `Postgres` connection, or a `Snowflake` connection).

A `sources` folder may look something like this:

```
sources/
   sales/
       connection.yaml
       sales_q3_22.csv
       sales_q4_22.csv
   application_analytics/
       connection.yaml
       page_views.sql
       bounce_rates.sql
```

This defines 2 data sources, each made up of a directory (e.g. `sales` or `application_analytics`) , and a `connection.yaml` file. 

The `connection.yaml` file contains details about what a data source is; including the type, and any connection
information.

A `postgres` connection would look something like this:

```yaml
name: local_postgres
type: postgres

options:
  user: ${environment_variable}
  password: ${environment_variable}
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  database: postgres
  ssl:
    rejectUnauthorized: false
```

### Sources 

The queries (SQL files and other) in the sources are executed and made available
as tables in your Evidence pages. Each of your source queries is executed
_at build time_, and the results are placed in a [parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) file. These files are then loaded and queried against in a viewer's browser using [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/).

This has a few implications on how projects are built:

- You can now query against _all_ your data sources, regardless of what they are
  - e.g. you can join `Postgres` data and `Snowflake` data in your project
- You can have fewer queries against your warehouses (for free!)
- You can interpolate variables into your SQL 
  - Interactive filters are now much easier to implement, and much more performant
  - Templated page variables can be used in queries, without needing to use Javascript

### Using the Example Database

The template includes a large example data set generated with a new [FakerJS](https://fakerjs.dev) connector. Each of the tables returned by faker are defined in `.yaml` files (e.g. `social_media/comments.yaml`). 

Once you have built your sources `npm run sources`, and launched the dev server `npm run dev`. 

You can see the home page, and some example universal SQL queries against the data. 

We have also included a new schema explorer at `explore/schema` which lists all of the tables returned by your sources. 

### Passing inputs into queries 

The home page includes an example of passing user input directly into a SQL query, using the `${input}` syntax.

As you adjust the input, the query re-executes. 


### Adding additional connectors 

If you want to use your own data, you can add connectors to the project. See instructions below. 

1. Using the information in [References](#references) install the connectors you want to use
2. Create a new directory in `./sources`
3. Create a `connection.yaml` file
   1. You will need the following properties:
      1. `name`, arbitrary, currently unused
      2. `type`, database name (e.g. `Postgres` or `BigQuery`)
      3. `options`, see the reference for your database for the options needed
4. If using a SQL Connector, create some `.sql` files  
   1. Each of these files will create a table in the client database, which will be named after the file (e.g. `test.sql` becomes the `test` table)
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all the databases you would like
6. Run `npm run sources`
